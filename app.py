This script demonstrates how to build a machine learning
model using a Random Forest classifier.
It includes loading a dataset, preprocessing,
training the model, and evaluating its performance.
Optimizations and best practices for speed and accuracy are also suggested.

# Future optimization tips:
# 1. Explore different algorithms and their

# 2. Use feature importance scores to select the
# mostrelevant features for the model.
# 3. Consider implementing cross-validation for
# more robust model evaluation.
# 4. Optimize the code for parallel processing if
# dealing with large datasets or complex models.
# 5. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks and optimize them for speed.
